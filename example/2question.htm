                    <div class="message-bubble">Shall we first clarify 
what our fellows meant by "format"? Some spoke of moving from vinyl to 
cassettes, which made music portable and invited the making of mixtapes <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-17">[17]</a>. Others recalled the path from vinyl to compact disc <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-33">[33]</a>. Many remembered cassettes giving way to CDs, whether at home or when finally adding a CD player to the car <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-11">[11]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-38">[38]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-39">[39]</a>. Later shifts included CDs to digital downloads and the iPod, and then from downloads to streaming <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-19">[19]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-23">[23]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-14">[14]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-7">[7]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-22">[22]</a>.

One younger listener said it had not changed because as a child they followed their parentsâ€™ music <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-8">[8]</a>.
 Another recalled that the household added 8-tracks alongside albums 
rather than replacing them, so habits stayed much the same <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-50">[50]</a>. And for some, radio remained the primary way before and after <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-46">[46]</a>.</div>

                    <div class="message-bubble">For many others, access expanded: it became easier to find and hear different kinds of music, including outside the mainstream <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-5">[5]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-40">[40]</a>.
 People described having more music available, no longer needing hours 
of downloading and burning to CDs, and even being able to explore an 
artistâ€™s complete catalogue <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-9">[9]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-5">[5]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-25">[25]</a>. Some said they started listening to more music overall <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-30">[30]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-19">[19]</a>. Streaming, with a flat fee and no need to store files, encouraged more discovery and listening to new artists <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-7">[7]</a>. In places without easy access to stores, new formats improved access to new music <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-13">[13]</a>. Some remembered music becoming available online for free <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-35">[35]</a>.</div>

                    <div class="message-bubble">Listeners emphasized 
customization: new formats gave "freedom to experiment and explore" and 
felt "more customized than anything before" <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-6">[6]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-18">[18]</a>. They made and burned playlists on CDs and MP3 players, and could shuffle across many discs instead of being bound to one <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-24">[24]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-34">[34]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-41">[41]</a>.
 The shift from CDs to legal downloads let people pick individual tracks
 rather than whole albums, and some moved from albums to singles because
 it was cheaper to buy one song <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-23">[23]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-47">[47]</a>.

                    <div class="message-bubble">Sometimes the change 
demanded new equipment, like upgrading an audio setup or getting a car 
deck that handled both cassettes and CDs <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-2">[2]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-12">[12]</a>. People remembered having to rebuy favorite albums in the new format, yet appreciating the improvement in sound quality <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-20">[20]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-27">[27]</a>. Some noted the convenience: skipping quickly to songs, fewer tape problems, and the quieter, easier operation of CDs <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-31">[31]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-21">[21]</a>.
 As downloads rose, music stopped being as cost-prohibitive because one 
could buy individual tracks and make playlists without recording off the
 radio <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-36">[36]</a>. With iPods and computers, listening shifted from big stereos and disc players to digital devices <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-19">[19]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-28">[28]</a>.</div>

 A new car audio system changed formats in the vehicle, and CDs were 
easier to carry than cassettes, letting one bring variety instead of a 
single tape <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-12">[12]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-38">[38]</a>.

There was nostalgia for tapes and their paper inserts, even as people valued faster skipping and better reliability <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-31">[31]</a>.

 For many others, the new formats widened access and increased 
listening, from easier discovery and complete catalogues to more music

 Listening became more personalized: people curated playlists, shuffled 
across sources, and increasingly chose single tracks rather than whole 
albums <a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-24">[24]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-41">[41]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-23">[23]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-47">[47]</a><a href="#" class="citation" data-source-id="exchange-0-34">[34]</a>.

                    <strong>Question:</strong>
                    <span id="source-question">What do you remember about the shift from your earlier music format to the new one â€” or how it changed the way you listened?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Response:</strong>
                    <span id="source-verbatim">I remember having CDs and
 using Limewire sort of at the same time. I would make my own CDs to 
listen to of different artists that I liked. That didn't change much 
between illegal to legal downloads (I was still using Limewire when I 
got an iPod). It changed more once Spotify came out.</span>
